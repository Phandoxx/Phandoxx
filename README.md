## Hello, Im Phandoxx
- I’m currently working on a Java app to replace common PC apps
- I’m currently learning primarily Java
- Also a Tech Hardware Enthusiast
- Goal: To practice Java everyday and keep up a good commit history (Excluding Holidays ofc)

Reasons for missing commit days:
- 24-26th of october: Diwali (holiday) and small break in general
- 31th of october: Halloween (holiday)
